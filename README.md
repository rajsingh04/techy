## Lessons Learned
Understanding WebSockets and Real-Time Communication
During development, I gained in-depth knowledge of how WebSockets operate to enable continuous, bidirectional communication between a client and a server. I learned how Socket.IO simplifies WebSocket implementation by handling connection fallback mechanisms, event-based messaging, and room-based communication. This experience improved my understanding of event-driven architecture and the differences between traditional HTTP requests and persistent WebSocket connections.




## Features

- User Authentication â€“ Implemented secure sign-up, login, and session management to protect user data.

- MVC Architecture â€“ Structured the application using the Model-View-Controller pattern for better scalability and maintainability.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility â€“ Developed using Flutter to ensure seamless performance on both Android and iOS devices.
